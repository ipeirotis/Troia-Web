        Mechanical Turk and other crowdsourcing platforms allow for easy online distribution of tasks to users, allowing anyone to work on your tasks. Unfortunately, the answers submitted by the users are of imperfect quality: No worker is perfect. In fact, some workers can be submitting completely random results.
