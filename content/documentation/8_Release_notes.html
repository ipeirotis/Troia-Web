Release notes
*************

Troia 1.1 - April 5, 2013
===========================================

The main focus of this release is to:

* refactor Troia so that it allows an easy addition of new algorithms
* implement object scheduling functionality
* add Troia server configuration module

Features included in this release:
 
Troia server changes
-------------------

- major refactory on the core server structure, reflected also in the API
- implemented Incremental version of MV
- scheduler API implementation and documentation on Mashape
- changed "input" methods to use JSON object instead of form data when appropriate
- added the option to configure Troia outside the repository and the war file

Web development
---------------

- added the option for downloading job results on website demo
- added Scheduler API tutorial


Troia 1.0 - February 25, 2013
===========================================

The main objectives of this release are to:

* improve the existing code base and documentation
* integrate the manipulation of continuous variables into Troia Quality Control API.

Features included in this release:

API fixes
---------

- Added data entries Unicode support
- Added more meta JSON schema responses
- Updated the Mashape documentation on responses such that now it uses models ('redirect' uses different address for different requests)
- Jobs are not created anymore with given IDs; new jobs are given random JOB IDs
- Adapted documentation/tutorials/demo/tests to the above changes


GALC integration
----------------

- Added REST API entries for continuous jobs
- Integrated test data generator for continuous data
- Added the ability to run GALC from the command line (from the generated jar)
- Added persistency to GALC jobs
- Added API entry points for uploading multiple assigns, gold objects, objects

Web development
---------------

- Added web demo application for GALC
- Created GALC API related documentation on Mashape
- Created GALC usage tutorial
- Updated GAL web demo to show the new worker and data quality metrics



Troia 0.8 - December 31, 2012
===============================

This is the first release of Troia Quality Control API for crowdsourcing
applications.

Features included in this release.

Data and Data Management
------------------------

- Ability to upload data that have no labels assigned.
- Data persistence

Labeling Quality Evaluation Algorithms
--------------------------------------

- Dawid Skene (Default)
- Majority Voting

The algorithms above provide probability distribution estimates over all labels for
each object.

Label Choosing Methods
----------------------

- **Minimum Cost**: A method that selects the label(s) that minimize the overall misclassification cost.
- **Maximum Likelihood**: A method that selects label(s) with the highest probability as compared to the gold data.
- **Default**: A method that uses the probability estimates by the labeling quality evaluation algorithms.

*Both Minimum Cost and Maximum Likelihood methods return the same results
when misclassification costs are equal.*

Metrics
-------

- **Estimated**: Metrics related to the performance of the algorithm per se for the input data provided.
- **Evaluated**: Metrics based on evaluation data that used as benchmark for the actual algorithmic output.

Input Data Metrics
------------------

- **Data Cost**: The expected misclassification cost for any given data point.

Worker Quality Metrics
----------------------

- **Worker Cost**: The expected misclassification cost of the worker for any given labeling task.
- **Worker Quality**: A normalized version of the worker cost metric.
