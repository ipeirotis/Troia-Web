List of possible questions that we might put in website's FAQ:

GENERAL

Q: What are example use cases where Troia can be used?

A: Troia works great in scenarios when you have data from workers and you would like to verify them with some voting task. Using this votes Troia can predict which data are useful and estimate voting workers quality. Knowing who provided what data in first stage you can also estimate quality of workers that provided those data. Some real life examples:

    Photo tagging
    Machine Learning training data collection (example: to create algorithm that will be able to predict whether this site matches some topic - see URLAnnotator)

Q: How much data we need go get meaningful results?

A: ?

Q: What is the difference between MV, DS, GAL, GALC?

A: ? /// I don't know whether this question make sense

Deeper questions:

Q: How algorithm behaviors when we present it with doubled vote (worker A has given object B label X twice)

A: Those votes are counted as one vote. Moreover, if worker A assign object B label X and later he assign Y to this object only last vote will be used in computation

Q: Troia limits?

A: Current version can handle ... but we are still working  on ... . This should be enough to handle even largest jobs ...
