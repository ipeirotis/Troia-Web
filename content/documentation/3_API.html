Troia is service that runs within tomcat server and takes requests from via HTTP.
It uses POST and GET methods to send request data.

Service address
---------------
To call services provided by Troia you have to call HTTP connection to correct location.
Correct format is as follows

::

    http://<host>:<port>/<path>/rest/<service>

Where:

- <host> is address of host providing Troia
- <port> is port on with service is available
- <path> is path in with Troia files are located on server
- <service> is name of service that's going to be called

So for example if service is set up on local host in server path "GetAnotherLabel" with port 8080
configured address for ping service will look like that:

::

    http://localhost:8080/GetAnotherLabel/rest/ping

Requests
--------
Almost all services provided by Troia work on requests, each request contains set of objects,
workers, labels annotated by workers and gold labels. Request are identified by text id for
example "TestRequest" or "PornNoPornAnno_12.06.12". That's why requests must contain parameter
with name **id** and value of request identifier. Only services that do not require this parameter
are basic Troia functionality tests : "ping" and "pingDB".

Services overwiew
-----------------
Here is list of available services with information what method should be used to send them parameters.
As you can see some service names show up more then once, to see what that means you need to read
detailed description of this service in latter part of this tutorial

- ``ping`` : ``none``
- ``pingDB`` : ``none``
- ``reset`` : ``GET``
- ``exists`` : ``GET``
- ``loadCategories`` : ``POST``
- ``loadCosts`` : ``POST``
- ``loadWorkerAssignedLabel`` : ``POST``
- ``loadWorkerAssignedLabels`` : ``POST``
- ``loadGoldLabel`` : ``POST``
- ``loadGoldLabels`` : ``POST``
- ``majorityVote`` : ``GET``
- ``majorityVotes`` : ``POST``
- ``majorityVotes`` : ``GET``
- ``objectProbs`` : ``POST``
- ``objectProb`` : ``GET``
- ``printObjectsProbs`` : ``GET``
- ``objectProbs`` : ``GET``
- ``computeBlocking`` : ``GET``
- ``printWorkerSummary`` : ``GET``
- ``printPriors`` : ``GET``
- ``classPriors`` : ``GET``
- ``getDawidSkene`` : ``GET``

Services ping and pingDB do not send any parameters so request method is irrelevant.

JSON usage
----------
Most of those services send strings created by serializing objects with JSON as responses and require
similar format of parameter input. It means that to be able to correctly use Troia you will have
to recreate some of those objects on client side or alternatively manually parse JSON strings into
processable output. Troia is written in Java and uses *com.google.gson.Gson* class for serialization.
Below there is a description of classes that need to be recreated for simple use of Troia services,
of course their names and methods are not important.

Category
........
Category represents single category in request and besides name contains priority and misclassification
cost map. Fields:

- ``name`` : ``string``
- ``prior`` : ``double``
- ``misclassification_cost`` : ``Map<string,double>``

Label
.....
This class represents label assigned to object by worker. Fields:

- ``workerName`` : ``string``
- ``objectName`` : ``string``
- ``categoryName`` : ``string``

GoldLabel
.........
This class represents correct label for given object. Fields:

- ``objectName`` : ``string``
- ``correctCategory`` : ``string``

MisclassificationCost
.....................
This class contains cost of misclassification from one category to another. Fields:

- ``categoryFrom`` : ``string``
- ``categoryTo`` : ``string``
- ``cost`` : ``double``

Services detailed description
-----------------------------

This part of tutorial contains detailed description of available services.
**When parameters or return values are described as objects it means that in reality
they are or should be string resulting from JSON serialization.** For more detail on that
you should check part of this tutorial dealing with JSON usage in Troia.

ping
....
Ping is service used for testing if Troia server is up. If yes it should return string containing info
about date and hour of service realization for example :
 
::

    processing request at: 2012-07-18T12:03:06.037+02:00

pingDB
......
This is service used for testing if databases server used by Troia is up and accessible for modifications.
It tries to add and remove form database request with one category and id "1234512345".
Response of this service is string containing information similar to ping but also description
of actions it took towards database. Example of pingDB output :

::

    processing request at: 2012-07-18T12:08:03.196+02:00

    DawidSkene object with id=1234512345 has been inserted to the DB...

    DawidSkene object with id=1234512345 has been removed from the DB...successfully

reset
.....
Removes request with given id from Troia database and writes simple string if removal was succesfull.
Parameters :

- ``id`` : ``string``

exists
......
Returns boolean value indicating if request with given id exists.
Parameters:

- ``id`` : ``string``

loadCategories
..............
Uploads collection of categories to request with given id and returns a simple success message.
Parameters
 
- ``id`` : ``string``
- ``categories`` : ``Collection<Category>``

loadCosts
.........
Uploads collection of misclassification costs to request with given id and returns a simple success message.
Parameters:
 
- ``id`` : ``string``
- ``costs`` : ``Collection<Cost>``

loadWorkerAssignedLabel
.......................
Uploads single label to request with given id and returns a simple success message.
Parameters:

- ``id`` : ``string``
- ``data`` : ``Label``

loadWorkerAssignedLabels
........................
Uploads collection of labels to request with given id and returns a simple success message.

- ``id`` : ``string``
- ``data`` : ``Collection<Label>``

loadGoldLabel
.............
Uploads single gold label to request with given id and returns a simple success message.
Parameters :

- ``id`` : ``string``
- ``data`` : ``GoldLabel``

loadGoldLabels
..............
Uploads collection of gold labels to request with given id and returns a simple success message.

- ``id`` : ``string``

majorityVote
............
Computes majority vote for object that name was given as a parameter.

- ``id`` : ``string``
- ``objectName`` : ``string``

majorityVotes
.............
Calculates majority vote for objects that names were included in collection given
as a parameter. Parameters to this service can be sent via POST and GET as well.

Parameters:

- ``id`` : ``string``
- ``objects`` : ``Collection<String>``

objectProb

- ``object`` : ``string``

objectProbs
...........
Calculates probabilities of object category association for objects with names
given in string collection.
Returns map that translates object name into map associating probabilities with category names
(``Map<string,Map<string,double>>``)
Parameters:

- ``id`` : ``string``
- ``objects`` : ``Collection<string>``

computeBlocking
...............
Make a asynchronous callback to execute the iterative Dawid-Skene algorithm
Parameters:

- ``id`` : ``string``
