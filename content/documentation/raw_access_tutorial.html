What "raw access" means and why you should do it other way
----------------------------------------------------------
DSaS is service that runs on server and takes requests from clients via HTTP protocol.
More precisely it uses POST and GET methods to send request data.
This tutorial will focus on how to use this service without any client libraries henceforth 
"raw access" in title. This way of using DSaS is depreciated as it not only requires some
knowledge of service inside structure but also means that each time service provider will
change something in his code you will have to manually update all changes instead of just
updating client. This way of access and tutorial are dedicated to people who want to use
DSaS from that do not yet have client libraries created.

Service address
---------------
To call services provided by DSaS you have to call HTTP connection to correct location.
Correct format is as follows 

::

    http://<host>:<port>/<path>/rest/<service> 

Where:
 - <host> is address of host providing DSaS
 - <port> is port on with service is available
 - <path> is path in with DSaS files are located on server
 - <service> is name of service that's going to be called

So for example if service is set up on local host in server path "GetAnotherLabel" with port 8080
configured address for ping service will look like that :

::

    http://localhost:8080/GetAnotherLabel/rest/ping

Requests
--------
Almost all services provided by DSaS work on requests, each request contains set of objects,
workers, labels annotated by workers and gold labels. Request are identified by text id for
example "TestRequest" or "PornNoPornAnno_12.06.12". That's why requests must contain parameter
with name **id** and value of request identifier. Only services that do not require this parameter
are basic DSaS functionality tests : "ping" and "pingDB".

Services overwiew
-----------------
Here is list of available services with information what method should be used to send them parameters.
As you can see some service names show up more then once, to see what that means you need to read 
detailed description of this service in latter part of this tutorial

- ``ping`` : ``none``
- ``pingDB`` : ``none``
- ``reset`` : ``GET``
- ``exists`` : ``GET``
- ``loadCategories`` : ``POST``
- ``loadCosts`` : ``POST``
- ``loadWorkerAssignedLabel`` : ``POST``
- ``loadWorkerAssignedLabels`` : ``POST``
- ``loadGoldLabel`` : ``POST``
- ``loadGoldLabels`` : ``POST``
- ``majorityVote`` : ``GET``
- ``majorityVotes`` : ``POST``
- ``majorityVotes`` : ``GET``
- ``objectProbs`` : ``POST``
- ``objectProb`` : ``GET``
- ``printObjectsProbs`` : ``GET``
- ``objectProbs`` : ``GET``
- ``computeBlocking`` : ``GET``
- ``printWorkerSummary`` : ``GET``
- ``printPriors`` : ``GET``
- ``classPriors`` : ``GET``
- ``getDawidSkene`` : ``GET``

Services ping and pingDB do not send any parameters so request method is irrelevant.

JSON usage
----------
Most of those services send strings created by serializing objects with JSON as responses and require
similar format of parameter input. It means that to be able to correctly use DSaS you will have 
to recreate some of those objects on client side or alternatively manually parse JSON strings into
processable output. DSaS is written in Java and uses *com.google.gson.Gson* class for serialization.
Below there is a description of classes that need to be recreated for simple use of DSaS services,
of course their names and methods are not important.

Category
~~~~~~~~
Category represents single category in request and besides name contains priority and misclassification 
cost map. Fields:

- ``name`` : ``string``
- ``prior`` : ``double``
- ``misclassification_cost`` : ``Map<string,double>``

Label
~~~~~
This class represents label assigned to object by worker. Fields:

- ``workerName`` : ``string``
- ``objectName`` : ``string``
- ``categoryName`` : ``string``

GoldLabel
~~~~~~~~~
This class represents correct label for given object. Fields:

- ``objectName`` : ``string``
- ``correctCategory`` : ``string``

MisclassificationCost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class contains cost of misclassification from one category to another. Fields:

- ``categoryFrom`` : ``string``
- ``categoryTo`` : ``string``
- ``cost`` : ``double``

Services detailed description
-----------------------------

This part of tutorial contains detailed description of available services.
**When parameters or return values are described as objects it means that in reality
they are or should be string resulting from JSON serialization.** For more detail on that
you should check part of this tutorial dealing with JSON usage in DSaS.

ping
~~~~
Ping is service used for testing if DSaS server is up. If yes it should return string containing info
about date and hour of service realization for example : 
 
::

    processing request at: 2012-07-18T12:03:06.037+02:00

pingDB
~~~~~~
This is service used for testing if databases server used by DSaS is up and accessible for modifications.
It tries to add and remove form database request with one category and id "1234512345".
Response of this service is string containing information similar to ping but also description
of actions it took towards database. Example of pingDB output :

::

    processing request at: 2012-07-18T12:08:03.196+02:00

    DawidSkene object with id=1234512345 has been inserted to the DB...
