- Assigned Label: The label assigned by a worker to an object
- Gold Label: The correct label for an object; the algorithm uses it to estimate the quality of a worker
- Evaluation Label: The correct label for an object; this label is *not* used by the algorithm. It is only used to evaluate the output of the algorithm and understand the accuracy of the estimations


- Datum: The object that needs to be labeled. Has an id that is unique to the object.
- Label: The category (for the discrete case) or the value (for the continuous case) for the object.
- Assigned Label: The label assigned by a worker to an object
- Gold Label: The correct label for an object; the algorithm uses it to estimate the quality of a worker
- Evaluation Label: The correct label for an object; this label is *not* used by the algorithm. It is only used to evaluate the output of the algorithm and understand the accuracy of the estimations.
- Prior: The probability for a randomly chosen object to belong to a given category (discrete case) or to have a particular value (for the continuous case).
- Confusion Matrix: A n x n matrix that contains the probabilities of misclassifying an object of a given category. The value of the matrix in the [i,j] position is the probability of labeling an object that belongs to category i, as an object that belongs to category j.
- Cost Matrix: A n x n matrix that stores the cost of a misclassification.  The value of the matrix in the [i,j] position is the cost for labeling an object that belongs to category i, as an object that belongs to category j.
