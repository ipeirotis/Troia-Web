#. What are example use cases where Troia can be used?

	Troia works great in scenarios when you have data from workers and you would like to verify them with some voting task. Using this votes Troia can predict which data are useful and estimate voting workers quality. Knowing who provided what data in first stage you can also estimate quality of workers that provided those data. Some real life examples:

	- Photo tagging
	- Machine Learning training data collection (example: to create algorithm that will be able to predict whether this site matches some topic - see URLAnnotator)


#. How algorithm behaviors when we present it with doubled vote (worker A has given object B label X twice)

	Those votes are counted as one vote. Moreover, if worker A assign object B label X and later he assign Y to this object only last vote will be used in computation
