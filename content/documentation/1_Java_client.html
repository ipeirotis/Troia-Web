This document assumes that you know what Troia project is about and have already setup its server.

To use Troia service you must create a request with unique ID and service URL configured.
Then you must execute three steps :
 
- data upload
- algorithm execution (computeBlocking)
- results download

It is possible to download results before executing algorithm but that will result in 
an incomplete data, so you must be sure that you called *computeBlocking* function before 
downloading results.

To use Java client you should download latest version from git-hub. 
::

 git clone git://github.com/10clouds/Troia-Java-Client.git

After that you have to create jar package, you will need maven for that. 
To do that you need to enter Java client main directory where pom.xml is located 
and call maven with following command. :
::

 mvn package

This will create *TroiaJavaClient-1.0.jar* in *target* directory.
If you want to use maven in your project you will also have to call
::

 mvn clean install

This will install library in your local maven repository so it can be used 
while building other projects.

Including library in project
----------------------------
If you use maven then you simply need to add following dependency to your pom.xml file :
::
 
 <dependency>
  <groupId>TroiaJavaClient</groupId>
  <artifactId>TroiaJavaClient</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
 </dependency>

If you are using another build 
tool you must search tutorial on adding jars in it.
