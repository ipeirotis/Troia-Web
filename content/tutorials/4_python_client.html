============================================
Basic Troia implementation tutorial (Python)
============================================

This document assumes that you know what **Troia** project is about and have already setup its server.

Working example that we are going through in this tutorial is located in Troia Python client repository in *tutorial/tutorial.py*.


Example data
------------
We will go through example data that try to classify given website as containing sexual content or not.
For short we assume labels:

- porn
- notporn


Cost matrix
___________

Cost matrix defines how bad it is to wrongly classify sample with label A whereas its true label is B.

+---------+---------+---------+
|         |  porn   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
|  porn   | 0       | 1       |
+---------+---------+---------+
| notporn | 1       | 0       |
+---------+---------+---------+


Gold data
_________

Samples for which correct label is known.

+---------+---------+
|  url1   | notporn |
+---------+---------+
|  url2   |  porn   |
+---------+---------+


Labels assigned by workers
__________________________

Labels assigned by workers to given objects.


+---------+---------+---------+
| worker1 |  url1   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker1 |  url2   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker1 |  url3   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker1 |  url4   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker1 |  url5   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker2 |  url1   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker2 |  url2   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker2 |  url3   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker2 |  url4   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker2 |  url5   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker3 |  url1   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker3 |  url2   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker3 |  url3   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker3 |  url4   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker3 |  url5   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker4 |  url1   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker4 |  url2   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker4 |  url3   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker4 |  url4   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker4 |  url5   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker5 |  url1   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker5 |  url2   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker5 |  url3   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker5 |  url4   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+
| worker5 |  url5   | notporn |
+---------+---------+---------+



Requirements
------------

We need to import class **TroiaClient** from package **troia_client**.
It provides nice wrapping around calls to Troia Server.
You can do this:

::

  from troia_client import TroiaClient

For interactive usage from command line we suggest also importing **pprint** package.
It provides nice way to present Python structures.

::

  import pprint


Initialization
--------------

To initalize Troia Client

::

  troia_client = TroiaClient(TROIA_SERVER_URL, TIMEOUT)

TROIA_SERVER_URL is url to your Troia Server instance (by default *http://localhost:8080/GetAnotherLabel/rest/*).
TIMEOUT defines how much do we want to wait for typical request to Troia Server.
It is float that describes this time in seconds.
If you set it to None or to value equal or less than 0 that it will be disabled and we will wait much longer if needed.


We will use job id

::

  ID = 'TUTORIAL_PYTHON_CLIENT'


To make sure that we don't interfere with some existing data we will reset that job

::

  troia_client.reset(ID)



Sending data
------------

Cost matrix
___________

In Troia idea is to pass one row / column (it doesn't matter how you think of this) at time so we define costs of errors for class X by passing dictionary with labels as keys and floats as values.
We can group them in list and pass them all at once.
For our example data we can represent in Python as:

::

    cost_matrix = [
        ('porn', {
            'porn':     0.,
            'notporn':  1.,
        }),
        ('notporn', {
            'notporn':  0.,
            'porn':     1.,
        }),
    ]

Such cost matrix we can send to Troia Server:

::

  troia_client.load_categories(cost_matrix, ID)


Gold data
_________

In Python we would represent single gold sample as tuple with *object_id* and its *correct label*.
We can group them in list so that:

::

    gold_samples = [
        ('url1', 'notporn'),
        ('url2', 'porn'),
    ]

stores all gold samples.
We can easily add them to Troia in two ways:

::

    troia_client.load_gold_labels(gold_samples, ID)

or:

::

    for object_id, label in GOLD_SAMPLES:
        troia_client.load_gold_label(object_id, label, ID)


Labels assigned by workers
__________________________

In our case we would store single assign as tuple of *worker_id*, *object_id*, *label*.
We can group them in list so that we can send them all at once or send single assigns.

Python form:

::

    WORKERS_LABELS = [
        ('worker1', 'url1', 'porn'),
        ('worker1', 'url2', 'porn'),
        ('worker1', 'url3', 'porn'),
        ('worker1', 'url4', 'porn'),
        ('worker1', 'url5', 'porn'),
        ('worker2', 'url1', 'notporn'),
        ('worker2', 'url2', 'porn'),
        ('worker2', 'url3', 'notporn'),
        ('worker2', 'url4', 'porn'),
        ('worker2', 'url5', 'porn'),
        ('worker3', 'url1', 'notporn'),
        ('worker3', 'url2', 'porn'),
        ('worker3', 'url3', 'notporn'),
        ('worker3', 'url4', 'porn'),
        ('worker3', 'url5', 'notporn'),
        ('worker4', 'url1', 'notporn'),
        ('worker4', 'url2', 'porn'),
        ('worker4', 'url3', 'notporn'),
        ('worker4', 'url4', 'porn'),
        ('worker4', 'url5', 'notporn'),
        ('worker5', 'url1', 'porn'),
        ('worker5', 'url2', 'notporn'),
        ('worker5', 'url3', 'porn'),
        ('worker5', 'url4', 'notporn'),
        ('worker5', 'url5', 'porn'),
    ]


And sending them:

::

    troia_client.load_worker_assigned_labels(workers_labels, ID)

or:

::

    for worker, object_id, label in workers_labels:
        troia_client.load_worker_assigned_label(worker, object_id, label, ID)


Starting calculations
---------------------

To tell Troia Server to start calculations you have to make proper request.
You can do this that way:

::

    troia_client.compute_blocking(ITERATIONS, ID)

*ITERATIONS* says how many iterations should be performed by algorithm used in Troia Server.
During computation no other request will be processed, so you should just wait until this procedure finishes.


Getting results
---------------

Now we are ready to get some results.
To collect many statistics form Troia Server just call:

::

    results = troia_client.get_dawid_skene(ID)

You can print them in user friendly mode by typing:

::

    pprint.pprint(results)

but they will be very huge.

To see labels probability distribution:

::

    object_label_probabilities = [(object_id, params['categoryProbability'])
        for object_id, params in objects_data]
    # we extract label distributions for objects
    print "Object label probabilities:"
    pprint.pprint(sorted(object_label_probabilities))


You should get:

::

    Object label probabilities:
    [(u'url1', {u'notporn': 1.0, u'porn': 0.0}),
     (u'url2', {u'notporn': 0.0, u'porn': 1.0}),
     (u'url3', {u'notporn': 1.0, u'porn': 0.0}),
     (u'url4', {u'notporn': 0.0, u'porn': 1.0}),
     (u'url5', {u'notporn': 1.0, u'porn': 0.0})]


To extract worker summary:

::

    workers_summary = str(troia_client.print_worker_summary(True, ID))
    print "Workers summary:"
    print workers_summary


And you should see:

::

    Workers summary:
