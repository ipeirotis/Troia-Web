What this tutorial is about?
============================
This tutorial would show you, step by step, how to play with Troia Server. We will use `cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`_ to communicate with Troia Server API.

Create job
----------
To create new job with **id** equal to some *<JOB_ID>* simply enter:
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs" -d 'id=<JOB_ID>&type=batch&categories=
    [{
        "prior":"0.5",
        "name":"porn",
        "misclassification_cost":
        {
            "porn":"0",
            "notporn":"1"
        }
    },
    {
        "prior":"0.5",
        "name":"notporn",
        "misclassification_cost":
        {
            "porn":"1",
            "notporn":"0"
        }
    }]'

We need also send collection of **categories**, containing their names, priorities and misclassification costs matrix.
As you can see there's another, optional parameter **type**, which have two possible values: *batch, incremental* determinig type of DawidSkene.

As a result we get JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T12:27:28.926Z",
        "result":"New job created with ID: <JOB_ID>",
        "status":"OK"
    }


Load assigned labels
--------------------
Send labels that worker assigned to objects.
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels" -d 'labels=
    [{
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    }]'

As a result we get JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:14:41.299Z",
        "status":"OK",
        "redirect":"responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels"
    }

where <RESPONSE_ID> is some generated id.
That means we need to call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels

to see what is the status of calling load assigned labels method.
As a result we get another JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:22:09.849Z",
        "result":"Assigns added",
        "status":"OK"
    }

This way of getting command results concerns all of the following methods.

Load gold labels
----------------
Send samples for which we know correct label. That would allow algorithm to a better estimation of workers quality and what is connected with this better estimation of correct labels.
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/goldData" -d 'labels=
    [{
        "correctCategory": "notporn",
        "objectName": "http://google.com"
    }]'

Similarly as previously, as a result we get:
::

    
    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:15:41.299Z",
        "status":"OK",
        "redirect":"responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/goldData"
    }

Start compute
-------------
We start actual calculations:
::

    curl -X POST -d "iterations=20" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/compute"

As a result, as previously we get JSON containg redirect uri:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:39:07.769Z",
        "status":"OK",
        "redirect":"responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/compute"
    }
    
We can check if computation has ended by checking its status:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/compute"

If dataset is huge and we checked status just after start computation call we'll get:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:22:09.849Z",
        "status":"NOT_READY"
    }

Get results
-----------

Workers qualities
+++++++++++++++++

To collect workers results we call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/prediction/workersScore"

and as previous we get JSON containing redirect uri. Following the link we get stats including workers error rate, quality (both optimized and exptected), number of annotations, number of gold tests and their confusion matrix.

To see what are the workers qualities call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/prediction/workersQuality"

Below are the qualities of workers for provided data. 
::

	{
	   "timestamp":"2013-01-16T14:44:33.625Z",
	   "result":{
	      "worker2":0.(4),
	      "worker3":1.0,
	      "worker4":1.0,
	      "worker5":1.0,
	      "worker1":0
	   },
	   "status":"OK"
	}

Returned qualities coincide with our assumptions about the workers:

- worker1 is lazy, and gives the answer porn all the time (quality = 0)
- worker2 is ok but not great. For example, labeled object5 as porn even though it is notporn (quality = 0.(4))
- worker3 and worker4 are high-quality workers (quality = 1)
- worker5 is malicious, giving always the incorrect answer, trying to fool the system (quality = 1 but error rate which we can get from previuos call is 1)

Label predictions
+++++++++++++++++

To see what are the most likely categories for data use:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/prediction/data?algorithm=DS&labelChoosing=MaxLikelihood"

As you can see there are two parameters:

- **algorithm**, which have two possible values: default *DS* (DawidSkene), *MV* (MajorityVote),
- **labelChoosing**, which have two passible values: default *MaxLikelihood*, *MinCost*.

As usual we get JSON containing redirect uri. Folowing the link we get result similar to:
::

	{
	   "timestamp":"2013-01-16T14:46:58.126Z",
	   "result":{
	      "http://google.com":"notporn",
	      "http://youporn.com":"porn",
	      "http://sunnyfun.com":"notporn",
	      "http://sex-mission.com":"porn",
	      "http://yahoo.com":"notporn"
	   },
	   "status":"OK"
	}
	
Label probability distribution for single object
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We can also see what is the label probability distribution for objects by calling:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/data/http://sunnyfun.com/categoryProbability"

There is optional parameter:

- **type**, which have two possible values: default *DS* (DawidSkene), *MV* (MajorityVote).

Following the returned redirect uri we get result:
::

	{
	    "result": {
	        "notporn": 1.0, 
	        "porn": 0.0
	    }, 
	    "status": "OK", 
	    "timestamp": "2013-01-17T13:55:59.188+01:00"
	}
