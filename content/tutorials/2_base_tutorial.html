What this tutorial is about?
============================
This tutorial would show you, step by step, how to play with Troia Server. We will use `cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`_ to communicate with Troia Server API.

Create job
----------
To create new job with **id** *troia_tutorial* simply enter:
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs" -d 'id=troia_tutorial&type=batch&categories=
    [{
        "prior":"1",
        "name":"porn",
        "misclassification_cost":
        {
            "porn":"0",
            "notporn":"1"
        }
    },
    {
        "prior":"1",
        "name":"notporn",
        "misclassification_cost":
        {
            "porn":"1",
            "notporn":"0"
        }
    }]'

We need also send collection of **categories**, containing their names, priorities and misclassification costs matrix.
As you can see there's another, optional parameter **type**, which have two possible values: *batch, incremental* determinig type of DawidSkene.

As a result we get JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T12:27:28.926Z",
        "result":"New job created with ID: troia_tutorial",
        "status":"OK"
    }


Load assigned labels
--------------------
Send labels that worker assigned to objects.
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/assignedLabels" -d 'labels=
    [{
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://sex-mission.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://google.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://youporn.com",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker5",
        "objectName":"http://yahoo.com",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    }]'

As a result we get JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:14:41.299Z",
        "status":"OK",
        "redirect":"1"
    }

That means we need to call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/status/1"

to see what is the status of calling load assigned labels method.
As a result we get another JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:22:09.849Z",
        "result":"Assigns added",
        "status":"OK"
    }

This way of getting command results concerns all of the following methods.

Load gold labels
----------------
Send samples for which we know correct label. That would allow algorithm to a better estimation of workers quality and what is connected with this better estimation of correct labels.
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/goldData" -d 'labels=
    [{
        "correctCategory": "notporn",
        "objectName": "http://google.com"
    }]'

Start compute
-------------
We start actual calculations
::

    curl -X POST -d "iterations=20" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/compute"

As a result, as previously we get JSON containg redirect id:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:39:07.769Z",
        "status":"OK",
        "redirect":"5"
    }
    
We can check if computation has ended by checking its status:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/status/5"

If dataset is huge and we checked status just after start computation call we'll get:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:22:09.849Z",
        "status":"NOT_READY"
    }

Get results
-----------

Workers qualities
+++++++++++++++++

To collect workers results we call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/prediction/workersScore"

Stats include workers error rate, quality (both optimized and exptected), number of annotations, number of gold tests and their confusion matrix.

To see what are the workers qualities call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/prediction/workersQuality"

Below are the qualities of workers for provided data. 
::

	{
	   "timestamp":"2013-01-16T14:44:33.625Z",
	   "result":{
	      "worker2":-0.11111111111111116,
	      "worker3":1.0,
	      "worker4":1.0,
	      "worker5":1.0,
	      "worker1":-1.0
	   },
	   "status":"OK"
	}

Returned qualities coincide with our assumptions about the workers:

- worker1 is lazy, and gives the answer porn all the time (quality = -1)
- worker2 is ok but not great. For example, labeled object5 as porn even though it is notporn (quality = -0.(1)6)
- worker3 and worker4 are high-quality workers (quality = 1)
- worker5 is malicious, giving always the incorrect answer, trying to fool the system (quality = 1 but error rate which we can get from previuos call is 1)

Label predictions
+++++++++++++++++

To see what are the most likely categories for data use:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/prediction/data?algorithm=DS&labelChoosing=MaxLikelihood"

As you can see there are two parameters:

- **algorithm**, which have two possible values: default *DS* (DawidSkene), *MV* (MajorityVote),
- **labelChoosing**, which have two passible values: default *MaxLikelihood*, *MinCost*.

Results:
::

	{
	   "timestamp":"2013-01-16T14:46:58.126Z",
	   "result":{
	      "http://google.com":"notporn",
	      "http://youporn.com":"porn",
	      "http://sunnyfun.com":"notporn",
	      "http://sex-mission.com":"porn",
	      "http://yahoo.com":"notporn"
	   },
	   "status":"OK"
	}
	
Label probability distribution for single object
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We can also see what is the label probability distribution for objects by calling:
::

	curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/troia_tutorial/data/http://sunnyfun.com/categoryProbability"
	
There is optional parameter:

- **type**, which have two possible values: default *DS* (DawidSkene), *MV* (MajorityVote).

Result:
::

	{
	    "result": {
	        "notporn": 1.0, 
	        "porn": 0.0
	    }, 
	    "status": "OK", 
	    "timestamp": "2013-01-17T13:55:59.188+01:00"
	}
