What this tutorial is about?
============================
This tutorial would show you, step by step, how to play with Troia Server. We will use `cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`_ to communicate with Troia Server API.

Create job
----------

To create new job enter:
::

	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs" -d '{
        categories: ["porn", "notporn"],
        categoryPriors: [
            {"categoryName": "porn", "value": 0.5},
            {"categoryName": "notporn", "value": 0.5}],
        costMatrix: [
            {"from": "porn", "to": "notporn", "value": 1.0},
            {"from": "porn", "to": "porn", "value": 0.0},
            {"from": "notporn", "to": "porn", "value": 1.0},
            {"from": "notporn", "to": "notporn", "value": 0.0}],
        algorithm: "BDS",
        iterations: 10,
        epsilon: 0.0001,
        scheduler: "NormalScheduler",
        prioritycalculator: "CostBased"
    }'

There are couple of parameters needs explenation:

- **categories**: collection of categories names
- **categoryPriors** (optional): the probability for a randomly chosen object to belong to a given category
- **costMatrix** (optional): n x n matrix that stores the cost of a misclassification (n is number of categories). The value of the matrix in the [i,j] position is the cost for labeling an object that belongs to category i, as an object that belongs to category j. If not given the cost matrix would be instatitaed as 0-1 matrix with 0 values on the main diagonal.
- **algorithm** (optional): type of algorithm; possible values are: blockingEM (aka BDS, default one), onlineEM (aka IDS), blockingMV (aka BMV), onlineMV (aka IMV).
- **iterations** (optional): only for blocking algorithms, default is 10
- **epsilon** (optional): only for blocking algotithms, default is 1e-6
- **scheduler** (optional): type of used scheduler (more about scheduler in Scheduler Tutorial); possible values are NormalScheduler, CachedScheduler
- **prioritycalculator** (optional): type of calculator used by scheduler;


As a result we get the following JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T12:27:28.926Z",
        "result":"New job created with ID: <JOB_ID>",
        "status":"OK"
    }

Note that the response contains the job ID. It is neccessary to pass the generated id to all the other endpoints that operate on jobs.


Load assigned labels
--------------------
Send labels that worker assigned to objects.
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assigns" -d '{
        assigns:
            [{
                "worker":"worker1",
                "object":"http://sunnyfun.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker1",
                "object":"http://sex-mission.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker1",
                "object":"http://google.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker1",
                "object":"http://youporn.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker1",
                "object":"http://yahoo.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker2",
                "object":"http://sunnyfun.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker2",
                "object":"http://sex-mission.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker2",
                "object":"http://google.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker2",
                "object":"http://youporn.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker2",
                "object":"http://yahoo.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker3",
                "object":"http://sunnyfun.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker3",
                "object":"http://sex-mission.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker3",
                "object":"http://google.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker3",
                "object":"http://youporn.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker3",
                "object":"http://yahoo.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker4",
                "object":"http://sunnyfun.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker4",
                "object":"http://sex-mission.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker4",
                "object":"http://google.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker4",
                "object":"http://youporn.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker4",
                "object":"http://yahoo.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker5",
                "object":"http://sunnyfun.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker5",
                "object":"http://sex-mission.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker5",
                "object":"http://google.com",
                "label":"porn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker5",
                "object":"http://youporn.com",
                "label":"notporn"
            },
            {
                "worker":"worker5",
                "object":"http://yahoo.com",
                "label":"porn"
            }]
        }'

As a result we get JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:14:41.299Z",
        "status":"OK",
        "redirect":"responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels"
    }

where <RESPONSE_ID> is some generated id.
That means we need to call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels

to see what is the status of calling load assigned labels method.
As a result we get another JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:22:09.849Z",
        "result":"Assigns added",
        "status":"OK"
    }

This way of getting command results concerns all of the following methods.

Load gold labels
----------------
Send samples for which we know correct label. That would allow algorithm to a better estimation of workers quality and what is connected with this better estimation of correct labels.
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/goldObjects" -d '{
        objects:
            [{
                "goldLabel": "notporn",
                "name": "http://google.com"
            }]
        }'

Similarly as previously, as a result we get:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:15:41.299Z",
        "status":"OK",
        "redirect":"responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/goldObjects"
    }

Start compute
-------------
We start actual calculations:
::

    curl -X POST "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/compute"

As a result, as previously we get JSON containg redirect uri:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:39:07.769Z",
        "status":"OK",
        "redirect":"responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/compute"
    }

We can check if computation has ended by checking its status:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/responses/<RESPONSE_ID>/POST/jobs/<JOB_ID>/compute"

If dataset is huge and we checked status just after start computation call we'll get:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:22:09.849Z",
        "status":"NOT_READY"
    }

Get results
-----------

Workers confusion matrices
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To see workers' confusion matrices, call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/workers/quality/matrix"

and as previous we get JSON containing the redirect uri. Following the link we get the confusion matrix for each worker


Estimated workers quality
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To see what are the workers qualities call:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/workers/quality/estimated" -d "{costAlgorithm: <COST_ALGORITHM>}


Where <COST_ALGORITHM> is an optional parameter (the default value is ExpectedCost) and represents the cost algorithm used to calculate the workers quality. Other cost algorithms are MaxLikelihood and MinCost.
Below are the qualities of workers for provided data.
::

	{
	   "timestamp":"2013-01-16T14:44:33.625Z",
	   "result":[
	      {"workerName":"worker2","value":0.4444444444444444},
	      {"workerName":"worker3","value":1.0},
	      {"workerName":"worker4","value":1.0},
	      {"workerName":"worker5","value":1.0},
	      {"workerName":"worker1","value":0.0}
	   ],
	   "status":"OK"
	}

Returned qualities coincide with our assumptions about the workers:

- worker1 is lazy, and gives the answer porn all the time (quality = 0)
- worker2 is ok but not great. For example, labeled object5 as porn even though it is notporn (quality = 0.(4))
- worker3 and worker4 are high-quality workers (quality = 1)
- worker5 is malicious, giving always the incorrect answer, trying to fool the system (quality = 1 but the error rate - calculated based on the confusion matrix - is 1)

Objects predictions
+++++++++++++++++++

In order to see what are the most likely categories for data, use:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/objects/prediction -d "{labelChoosing: <LABEL_CHOOSING_METHOD>}"

Where <LABEL_CHOOSING_METHOD> can have two passible values: *MaxLikelihood* (default) and *MinCost*.

As usual we get JSON containing redirect uri. Folowing the link we get result similar to:
::

	{
	   "timestamp":"2013-01-16T14:46:58.126Z",
	   "result":[
	       {"objectName":"http://google.com","categoryName":"notporn"},
	       {"objectName":"http://youporn.com","categoryName":"porn"},
	       {"objectName":"http://sunnyfun.com","categoryName":"notporn"},
	       {"objectName":"http://sex-mission.com","categoryName":"porn"},
	       {"objectName":"http://yahoo.com","categoryName":"notporn"}
	   ],
	   "status":"OK"
	}

Label probability distribution for single object
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We can also see what is the label probability distribution for objects by calling:
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/objects/http://sunnyfun.com/categoryProbability"

Following the returned redirect uri we get result:
::

    {
        "result": [
            {
                "categoryName": "notporn",
                "value": 1.0
            },
            {
                "categoryName": "porn",
                "value": 0.0
            }
        ],
        "status": "OK",
        "timestamp": "2013-01-17T13:55:59.188+01:00"
    }
