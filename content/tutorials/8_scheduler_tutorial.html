What this tutorial is about?
============================
The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how the scheduler functions are used in Troia. 
API calls will be done using `cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`


There are two types of schedulers implemented into Troia:
	- CachedScheduler - puts out the object after it is requested and keeps it out for a given amount of time so that it won't be returned within this time or until a new assign related to it is added
	- NormalScheduler - returns the same object until a new assign is added

In order to be able to set up the priority of each object and to return the object with the highest priority, schedulers need to calculate object priority. There are two types of calculators used:
	- CostBased - the object with the highest priority is the object with highest cost
	- AssignCount - the object with highest priority is the object with the smallest number of assigns

CachedScheduler
###############

Create a new job
----------------
To create new job enter:
::

	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs" -d '{
		categories: ["porn", "notporn"],
		categoryPriors: [
		    {"categoryName": "porn", "value": 0.5},
		    {"categoryName": "notporn", "value": 0.5}],
		costMatrix: [
		    {"from": "porn", "to": "notporn", "value": 1.0}, 
		    {"from": "porn", "to": "porn", "value": 0.0}, 
		    {"from": "notporn", "to": "porn", "value": 1.0}, 
		    {"from": "notporn", "to": "notporn", "value": 0.0}],
		algorithm: "BDS",
		iterations: 10,
		epsilon: 0.0001,
		scheduler: "CachedScheduler",
		calculator: "AssignCount"
	}'

As a result we get JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T12:27:28.926Z",
        "result":"New job created with ID: <JOB_ID>",
        "status":"OK"
    }

Note, that the response contains job ID. It is neccessary to pass the generated id to all the other endpoints that operate on jobs.


Load assigned labels
--------------------
Send labels that worker assigned to objects.
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels" -d 'labels=
    [{
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"object1",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"object1",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"object1",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"object1",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"object2",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"object2",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"object2",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"object3",
        "categoryName":"notporn"   
    }]'

As a result we get the result JSON and if we follow the redirect we get the confirmation that the assigns were added 
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:22:09.849Z",
        "result":"Assigns added",
        "status":"OK"
    }

So we have the following set of assigned labels:
	- object1 - 4 labels
	- object2 - 3 labels
	- object3 - 1 label

Get the object with highest priority
------------------------------------
We require the object with highest priority calling 
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/nextObject"

As a result, we get the following JSON:
::

    {
        "executionTime": 0.0, 
        "timestamp": "2013-04-05T14:54:19.235+03:00", 
        "status": "OK", 
        "result": 
        {
        	"name": "object3"
        }
    }
    
Expected? Yes, because object3 has the least amount of assigns and thus the highest priority, according to AssignCount calculator.

Now, let's see what happens if we call the second time
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/nextObject"

As a result, as previously, we get the JSON:
::

    {
        "executionTime": 0.0, 
        "timestamp": "2013-04-05T14:54:19.235+03:00", 
        "status": "OK", 
        "result": 
        {
        	"name": "object2"
        }
    }

This is also fine because object2 is the next object with the highest priority

Now, if we add a new label, the object priorities are recomputed. So if we call:
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels" -d 'labels=
    [{
        "workerName":"worker4",
        "objectName":"object3",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    }]'
    
And then 

::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/nextObject"

We will retrieve
::

    {
        "executionTime": 0.0, 
        "timestamp": "2013-04-05T14:54:19.235+03:00", 
        "status": "OK", 
        "result": 
        {
        	"name": "object3"
        }
    }


NormalScheduler
###############

Create a new job
----------------
To create new job enter:
::

	curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs" -d '{
		categories: ["porn", "notporn"],
		categoryPriors: [
		    {"categoryName": "porn", "value": 0.5},
		    {"categoryName": "notporn", "value": 0.5}],
		costMatrix: [
		    {"from": "porn", "to": "notporn", "value": 1.0}, 
		    {"from": "porn", "to": "porn", "value": 0.0}, 
		    {"from": "notporn", "to": "porn", "value": 1.0}, 
		    {"from": "notporn", "to": "notporn", "value": 0.0}],
		algorithm: "BDS",
		iterations: 10,
		epsilon: 0.0001,
		scheduler: "NormalScheduler",
		calculator: "AssignCount"
	}'

As a result we get JSON:
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T12:27:28.926Z",
        "result":"New job created with ID: <JOB_ID>",
        "status":"OK"
    }

Note, that the response contains job ID. It is neccessary to pass the generated id to all the other endpoints that operate on jobs.


Load assigned labels
--------------------
Send labels that worker assigned to objects.
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels" -d 'labels=
    [{
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"object1",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"object1",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"object2",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker2",
        "objectName":"object2",
        "categoryName":"notporn"
    },
    {
        "workerName":"worker3",
        "objectName":"object2",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    }]'

As a result we get the result JSON and if we follow the redirect we get the confirmation that the assigns were added 
::

    {
        "timestamp":"2012-12-29T13:22:09.849Z",
        "result":"Assigns added",
        "status":"OK"
    }

So we have the following assigned labels:
	- object1 - 2 labels
	- object2 - 3 labels

Get the object with highest priority
------------------------------------
We require the object with highest priority by calling 
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/nextObject"

As a result, we get the following JSON:
::

    {
        "executionTime": 0.0, 
        "timestamp": "2013-04-05T14:54:19.235+03:00", 
        "status": "OK", 
        "result": 
        {
        	"name": "object1"
        }
    }
    
Expected? Yes, because object1 has the least amount of assigns and thus the highest priority, according to AssignCount calculator

Now, let's see what happens if we call the second time
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/nextObject"

We get the following JSON:
::

    {
        "executionTime": 0.0, 
        "timestamp": "2013-04-05T14:54:19.235+03:00", 
        "status": "OK", 
        "result": 
        {
        	"name": "object1"
        }	
    }

This is also fine because there were no assigns added and object1 still has the highest priority 

If we add a another assigned label
::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/assignedLabels" -d 'labels=
    [{
        "workerName":"worker1",
        "objectName":"object3",
        "categoryName":"porn"
    }]'
    
When we call
::

    curl -X GET "http://project-troia.com/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>/nextObject"

We get the JSON:
::

    {
        "executionTime": 0.0, 
        "timestamp": "2013-04-05T14:54:19.235+03:00", 
        "status": "OK", 
        "result": 
        {
        	"name": "object3"
        }
    }

This is a proof that the object priorities are recomputed when new assigns are added
