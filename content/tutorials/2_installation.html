Before setting up Troia you have to configure environment on target computer
so it can prepare and run this service. You have to download following software
 
* tomcat - http://tomcat.apache.org/
* mysql - http://www.mysql.com/

.. raw:: html

    <a class="btn btn-info" href="/media/downloads/GetAnotherLabel.war">
        <i class="icon-download icon-white"></i>
        Download precompiled WAR file
    </a><p>&nbsp;</p>
 
If you want to compile Troia from source you will need:

* git - http://git-scm.com
* maven - http://maven.apache.org/

Note that if you have package manager, like Synaptic, you can simply download all this software with it.
If you are going to use package manager remember to download *tomcat6-admin* package as well.
As for servlet container you can use different one but this tutorial will be written with Tomcat in mind. 

Setting up Tomcat
-----------------

To be able to use administrative functions of Tomcat you must create user with administrator privileges.
You do that by modifying *tomcat-users.xml* file , if you are using Linux it's probably located at 
*/etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml* path. To create user with full required privileges you must add 
following line into this file 

::

    user username="administrator" password="drowssap" roles="admin,manager-gui" />

This will create user *administrator* with password *drowssap* and all privileges that will be needed
in this project.  
 
Deploying WAR
-------------

To deploy .war file open your Tomcat web application manager that should be under */manager/html* location.
Do if you are setting up this software on same computer that you are working on manager will be up at following
address:

::
 
    http://localhost:8080/manager/html

Then you should find part of manager that allows you to upload and deploy .war files from disk.
After that you should simply choose .war that was generated in previous step and deploy it.
To check if everything is working correctly you can open service that will ping Troia

::
  
    http://localhost:8080/GetAnotherLabel/rest/ping

Setting up a DB
---------------

To set up database you must use information from two files that are located in Troia/src/main/resources/ folder

* dawidskene.properties - that contains information about connection
* dawidprojects.sql - that contains database schema

**That covers all issues in regard of setting up Troia from precompiled WAR file, following part will instruct 
you how to build your own WAR file from sources downloaded from GitHub.**

Getting code
------------

Troia code is available at github under https://github.com/ipeirotis/Troia-Server address.
You have to enter directory in with you want to have Troia sources downloaded to and issue following command 

::
 
    git clone https://github.com/ipeirotis/Troia-Server

It will download all files from git repository into "Troia" directory so if command was issued from 
*/home/username/Documents* folder source files will end up with */home/username/Documents/Troia* as a 
project main directory.

Building WAR file
-----------------

To build WAR file you should enter project main directory execute following command 
::
 
    mvn package

Sometimes maven will inform about build failure due to failed test, in this case you should 
simply run maven without tests by calling a command with addnotational parameter

::

    mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true 

As a result *target* directory will appear, in it should be file called **GetAnotherLabel.war**.
